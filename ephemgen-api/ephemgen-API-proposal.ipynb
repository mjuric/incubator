    "What are Python generators? They are objects that generate sequences, and can be used in `for` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever run code such as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "you've used a generator -- the `range(10)` function returns one. These objects can be repeatedly \"asked\" for the next item in the sequence, until they're exhausted and the loop exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "As generators return one item at a time, they are incredibly useful as they allow streaming through large sequences, that may not necessarily fit into memory all at once. An example of this is reading a file line-by-line; this is also a generator, that returns the next line each time the `for` loop asks it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"big_file.txt\") as fp:\n",
    "    for line in fp:\n",
    "        ... do something with line ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples are all built-in generators, but Python allows us to write custom generators as well. The simplest way to do it is by writing a function that uses the `yield` keyword to return results. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def even_numbers(end):\n",
    "    i = 0\n",
    "    while i < end:\n",
    "        if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            yield i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This generator would be called by the user as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in even_numbers(100_000_000_000):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "to print out all even numbers amongst the first hundred trillion integers. Note that at no point in time there's more than /one/ number kept in memory -- though to a user of the for loop it seems like they're iterating through a list."
